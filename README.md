So you want to build an app? (Punahou Summer School Studen Application Template)


This is your Application template, we will be editing the code here to create your groups applications. 
The ToDo List web application is basically the basis of almost any web application. 
You can create a Gallery listing, News Feed (Facebook), Chat Room, etc with this template given you write the code it of course!



You will be working in the /styles/styles.css, /app/.app.js, and in the index.html  in the root directory files.
You will add in the missing code fields to finish the basic application and get it working.
Then push to github pages, publishing your groups website! You will be able to go to it at any time and see what you've done. (Go show off and be proud).



BONUS ROUND
Feel free to work within your groups, if you finish getting the basic application to work and have pushed to githubpages, to edit the basic app and create anything you want with this template!
